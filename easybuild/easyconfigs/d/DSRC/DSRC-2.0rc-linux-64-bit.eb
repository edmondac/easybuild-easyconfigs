description = """DNA Sequence Reads Compression is an application designed for compression of data files
 containing reads from DNA sequencing in FASTQ format. The amount of such files can be huge, e.g., a few
 (or tens) of gigabytes, so a need for a robust data compression tool is clear. Usually universal compression
 programs like gzip or bzip2 are used for this purpose, but it is obvious that a specialized tool can work better."""
