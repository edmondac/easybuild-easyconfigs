using density functional theory (DFT). It is based on the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-wave
((L)APW) + local orbitals (lo) method, one among the most accurate schemes for band structure calculations.
WIEN2k is an all-electron scheme including relativistic effects and has many features."""
