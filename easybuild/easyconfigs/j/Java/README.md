In order to use these configs you must first download Java from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).  

To install, you must past eb the sourcepath to find the download. For example, if the file is in /tmp your command might look something like:
`eb Java-1.8.0_162.eb -r --sourcepath=/tmp/`
