description = """pBWA is a parallel implementation of the popular software BWA. It was developed by modifying the BWA source code with the OpenMPI C library on the SHARCNET. pBWA has been successfully tested on other systems with the most basic OpenMPI installs. pBWA currently implements three commands from BWA: aln, samse, and sampe. pBWA retains and improves upon the multithreading provided by BWA while adding efficient parallelization for the above listed functions. pBWA has shown that its wall-time speedup is bounded only by the size of the parallel system available as pBWA can run on any number of nodes and/or cores simultaneously."""
